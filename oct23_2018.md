# Introduction to HTML 🌐
Information is shared on the web. Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the language that webpages are written in. When you navigate to a webpage, your browser receives a HTML document, interprets each line, and renders the text, graphics, buttons, etc. to your screen. In most browsers, you can look at the raw HTML text used to render the page by right clicking the page and selecting "view source."

> ### Give it a try! 
> Right click this or another webpage and click `view source`. Look at the HTML text that the page is rendered from. What do you see?

HTML is primarily responsible for how the page looks. The scope of this class (one day of web development) is limited to very basic HTML web development. On your own or in another class, you can learn how page styles can be controlled with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). You may also learn how to use JavaScript to perform actions on the page--such as causing something to happen when a button is clicked.

**The objective for today is to write a basic HTML document and put it online for anyone to access.**

# Create an HTML file
Open a text editor and create a new file. Save the file as `my_first.html`. HTML files always have the suffix `.html`. In the file explorer, double click the file. The file should open in a browser and will show only a blank screen. This is expected, because the file doesn't have anything in it.

# Basic HTML Structure
When you write a paper or essay there is a beginning, a middle, and an end. Each paragraph within the paper also has a beginning, middle, and end. Writing HTML is much like writing a paper--each element of the HTML document needs a beginning, a middle, and an end. The beginning and end of elements are marked with **tags**. Different types of tags tell the browser to format the contents differently on the page.

Tags are used in pairs and surround the content they refer to. It has an opening tag and a closing tag. For example:

    <tag> The content to display </tag>


## Skeleton HTML 🎃
The following is a bare-bones HTML page. Type this in your `my_first.html` document and refresh the page in your browser. Notice how tags the can be nested. 

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    
    <html>
    <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>

        <h1>My First Heading</h1>
        <p>My first paragraph.</p>

    </body>
    </html>

![](./images/html/skeleton.png)

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` is always the first line. It tells the browser that the file is an HTML document. It does not have a closing tag. 
- `<html>...</html>` indicates the HTML contents.
- `<head>...</head>` contains metadata for the page. Notice that the name of the page in the browser tab changed. The content does not display anything directly on the page.
- `<body>...</body>` is the main part of the page where the page's content is located.
- `<h1>...</h1>` is a header.
- `<p>...</p>` is a paragraph.

> ### HTML Comments
> It is _always_ good practice to comment your code. Comments are lines of code that are skipped by the program reading the code. In HTML you denote a comment line with `<!-- -->`.
>
> `<!-- This is a Comment -->`


## Some Basic Tags

|Tag|What it does|
|--|--|
|`<h1>`| Header. These are used by search engines to understand how the content on the page is organized.  Can also use `<h2>`,`<h3>`,...`<h6>` to indicate less important sections. _Do not use headers to just make text bigger!_|
|`<p>`| Paragraph|
|`<b>`| <b>Bold</b> text|
|`<u>`| <u>Underline</u> text|
|`<i>`| <i>Italicize</i> text|
|`<Subscript>`| <sub>Subscript</sub> text|
|`<sup>`| <sup>Superscript</sup> text|
|`<strike>`| <strike>Strike through</strike> text|
|`<mark>`| <mark>Highlight</mark> text|
|`<hr>`| Inserts a horizontal line across the page to separate content. **No closing tag**.|
|`<br>`| Insert a line break. **No closing tag**.|


## Tag Style Attributes
Style attributes change how the contents of the tags look, e.g. color, font size, etc.

    <tag style="property:value"> Content </tag>

For example, if I wanted to <span style='color:green'>make this text green</span>, I would do

    <p style="color:green"> This paragraph text will be green.</p>

The `<span>` tag, while it doesn't add any elements to the content, style attributes can be applied to it. You might want to use it when you want to apply style to a section of a paragraph or header, rather than the whole header.

    <h3>Last word will be <span style="color:blue;font-size:20"> blue and big </span></h3>

    <p>Just make <span style="color:green"> this </span> word green.</p>

There are some predefined color names, but you have more control over the exact color you want by using HEX or rgb values. [Google's color picker](https://www.google.com/search?q=color+picker)

For example: 

    style='color:#4286f4'
    style='color:rgb(0, 155, 62)'

> ### Try it yourself!
> Add some more text to your document and format it with different tags and style attributes.

## Hyperlinks
Hyperlinks are clickable text that navigate the browser window to a new location. It uses the `<a>` tag, which stands for "anchor." 
    
    <a href='https://www.google.com/'> Click Me </a>

If the `target=_blank` attribute is set, the link will be opened in a new window.

    <a href='https://www.utah.edu/' target=_blank> Click Me </a>

You may also open other html files you have written relative to the document's path.

    <a href='./my_second.html'> Click Me </a>

## Images
Images are inserted in HTML pages with the `<img>` tag. **No closing tag**. It requires the `src=''` attribute to define the source of the image. The source path may either be relative to your html document or a full url.

Often, images are not the size you want them to be. You can change image sizes with the `height=` and/or `width=` attribute.

    <img src='path-to-image' height=xx width=xx>

For example:

    <img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg' height=300>

> Note: If the `width` is set to a percent value, `width=75%`, the image will be the width relative to the browser window width.

## Lists
Lists are either unordered `<ul>`, or ordered `<ol>`. Each item in the list is indicated with a list item, `<li>`.

    <ul>
        <li>First Bullet</li>
        <li>Second Bullet</li>
        <li>Third Bullet</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>First item</li>
        <li>Second item</li>
        <li>Third item</li>
    </ol>

## Tables
A table, `<table>`, is made of rows, `<tr>`, and data, `<td>`.

    <table border="3" style="width:50%">
        <tr>
            <td>First Box, first row</td>
            <td>Second Box, first row</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>First Box, second row</td>
            <td>Second Box, second row</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

# Class Exercise: Make a web page

1. Create an HTML page about yourself.
    - Include your name, things you like to do,  etc.
    - Include a picture of yourself or something you like to do.
    - Look online for different attributes you can change to make the page "yours."

2. Copy the webpage, and all necessary files like images, to the CHPC server.
    - `scp file.html uXXXXXXX@meteo07.chpc.utah.edu:public_html/`
    - `scp img.png uXXXXXXX@meteo07.chpc.utah.edu:public_html/`

3. Verify the webpage works 
    http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~uXXXXXXX/

> ## Try some advanced, yet easy, web design
> An incredibly [popular framework](https://www.ostraining.com/blog/coding/bootstrap-popularity/) for designing webpages is [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). After you know a little HTML, it is relatively easy to learn an implement on your own pages by simple copy and pasting from tutorials.  
> - [Reference: Bootstrap Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/default.asp):  Copy and past the [first example](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_default&stacked=h) in a new HTML file and modifying it.
