# Course Description

<img src='./images/michael_goes16.PNG' width=500px align='center' >

- This is a short course
- Learning to program is similar to learning a spoken language:
  - is hard to do
  - is easier for some people than others
  - is difficult to learn how on your own by just reading a book
  - requires practice, lots of practice

# Course Description
  - Focus on the fundamentals and selected applications of scientific computer programming relevant to environmental fields
  - Environmental scientists need the ability to acquire and process environmental data and communicate results based on that processing efficiently
  - Stress skills necessary to solve physically-based problems using computational resources and methods
  - Focus on the linux computing environment using both the open source Python and proprietary Matlab languages
  - Programming concepts independent of language syntax are stressed  

# At the end of the course you will be able to do:
- Perform basic scientific calculations relevant to environmental fields using Python and MATLAB
- Use best practices to design, write and debug computer programs 
- Develop confidence to modify example codes to obtain new capabilities for the underlying code (i.e., progress onward from cookbook-style programming)
- Employ techniques to access, process,  and visualize environmental data sets on Linux computers

# How to succeed in this class
- Review these notes
- Review the links to info provided in the assignments and in the notes
- Organize the info in ways that help you access it quickly:
  - on your phone using an app?
  - Writing it down on a piece of paper, egads?
  - Writing it on a file accessible via ubox?
  - Ask questions using slack



  # Format
  - You must complete and turn in assignments by the assigned due date. There is no credit for late work without approval in advance to do so.   
  - Much of the instructional material will be online as pdf's of the powerpoints with "Check Your Understanding" assignments due tied to lectures on those subjects. 
  - Class sessions will be held in a Marriott Library computer lab  (1745MLIB) that allows for a mix of instructional  styles
  - brief lectures
  - follow along with the instructor and answer quick questions
  - independent lab work
  - You will need considerable  time beyond the scheduled class hours in the lab to complete assignments- many computing labs are available on campus.
  - See Marriott Knowledge Commons for resources in the library


  # Today’s Objectives
  - Review nuts and bolts of the class
  - https://utah.instructure.com/courses/504082
  - Introduce linux and linux basic commands on the Mac
  - Using slack

# What should you be doing?
  - Review all the material in these notes. Practice!
  - First Check Your Understanding due Friday midnight

# Getting Started
  - Use ubox or a several Gbyte USB device to copy files to/from MLIB computers
  - You won’t be able to complete assignments during class, so see when this lab and others are available from:
  - http://www.lib.utah.edu/services/classrooms/ and Marriott Knowledge Commons

  # Grading
  - Class participation and Check Your Understanding quizzes (30%)
  - Assignments (70%)
  - Plagiarizing, copying, or otherwise misrepresenting ones' work will not be tolerated
  - Final grades are based on the following scale:
  - 90 % + guarantees an A or A-;
  - 80 % + guarantees a B+, B, or B-
  - 70 % + guarantees a C+, C, or C-;
  - 60 % + guarantees a D+, D, or D-
  - below 60% may result in an E
  - Cutoff points for the specific grades are identified to define reasonable distribution of grades
  - You should retake the Check Your Understanding quizzes until you get them right

# Communication is key!
  - You can send questions using canvas
  - BUT, a better way may be to use slack!
  - Use this Invite to slack: https://join.slack.com/t/atmos-5020/shared_invite/enQtNDUxODI1Mjc0MzA5LTZmODhjZDk0MzVlYmM3NGRhOTk5MjY1ZmQ5OTEwZDUzMzg2NmZlNDlhZDFmZjA4ZDAzNTQ4NzVjZGNjMGY1ODc

  - You can download the slack app to your phone, computer, or just use it from a browser
  - As part of the first assignment, you are to send me a couple messages using slack
  - You will be answering poll questions using slack today

# The nuts and bolts

<img src='./images/computer_1.png' width=500px align='center' >

  - modern computers have:
   - 2-4 “cores” or central processing units (cpus)
  - Each cpu has ram (most used) and cache (fastest access) memory
  - some storage medium/disk
  - “peripherals” are that: peripheral


# What is UNIX?
- command line operating system developed in late 60’s at Bell Labs
- Multi-Tasking, multi-user O/S
- Originally written using C
- Unix is designed so that users can extend the functionality:
      - To build new tools easily and efficiently
      - To customize the shell and user interface.
      - To string together a series of Unix commands to create new functionality.
      - To create custom commands that do exactly what we want.
- ~1990 Linus Torvalds of Helsinki University developed an open source/academic version of Unix- Linux

# Mac OS X- a variant of Linux
- Other variants: Ubuntu, Red Hat, and Centos
- Some history: https://www.linux.com/news/linus-torvalds-reflects-25-years-linux
- Mac OS X has a "desktop environment” to provide a graphical user interface to application programs and system settings
- Can use the basic features of linux on a Mac using the terminal, XQuartz, Atom application programs

# Really want to get started?

# Shell

<img src='./images/shell.png' width=300px align='right' style='padding-left:30px'>

The “Shell” is simply the layer on top of the operating system that provides a basic human-OS interface.
  - It is a command interpreter
  - Built on top of the operating system kernel
  - Enables users to run services provided by the UNIX OS
  - In its simplest form, a series of commands in a file is a shell program that saves having to retype commands to perform common tasks.

# Logging onto the Mac
  - Username and password are the ones you use for Canvas, CIS, umail, etc.
  - Wait a long time…
  - When menu shows at the bottom, click on the left most: Finder
  - Look under Applications
  - Utilities
    - Terminal
    - XQuartz
  - Programming
  - Science and engineering
# Linux on Mac
  	1.  Open x-term window using terminal or XQuartz
  	2.  echo $SHELL
  	3.  if not tcsh, then type exec tcsh or just tcsh
  	4.  do stuff …
  	5.  When done, type exit

  - ALWAYS REMEMBER TO EXIT terminal windows and LOG OUT when completely done
  - Everything is wiped from disk and memory once you log out!!

# Unix Shells
  - The tcsh shell
  - The tc shell is a variation of the C shell.
  - It reads the same configuration files that the C shell uses.
  - Tcsh contains command line editing keystrokes that the C shell is missing, and has more "modern" conveniences that the C shell lacks.

  	1. Simple design, organization and functioning
  	2. Portability
  	3. Background processing
  	4. Hierarchical File System
  	5. Multi-user

# Unix File System
  - The Unix file system is the structure in which all the information on your computer is stored.
  - It has hierarchical file structure, where each directory can contain files, as well as other directories.
  - It looks like an upside down tree.
  - Unix looks at everything as a file.
  - At the top is the root directory, represented by a forward slash (/).
  - Then, there are a set of common directories such as /bin, /dev, /home, etc.

  The diagram shows the Linux file structure



# Try this!
- type ‘pwd’ (no quotes just type pwd)

  `pwd`
- You are on a local disk on this Mac, each local disk is separate from the others
- This is your “home” directory on this specific computer
- Type `ls`
- You are looking at the subdirectories created by the library
- `cd Desktop`
- `pwd`
- `cd ..`
- Question: Where are you now? Answer the poll question in slack:
  - Desktop?
  - Home  directory?
  - No clue? Help!!

# Creating a file: Do this!
- `cd`  (where are you now?)
- `ls`
- `ls  > subdirs.txt`
- `ls` (what now is in the directory?)
- `more subdirs.txt` (what do you see?)
- `cp subdirs.txt Desktop/`
- What’s now on your Desktop screen?
- Double click What do you see? Answer this in slack

# Unix File System


  <img src='./images/block.PNG' width=500px align='center' >


  - In Windows file systems, drive letters represent different storage devices like C: is a hard disk, etc.
  - In Linux, all storage devices are in the same file system hierarchy.
  - Windows file systems uses backslash (\) to separate directory names, whereas Linux uses forward slash (/) for the same.
  - Every file and directory in a Linux system has permissions and ownership associated with it.
  - File names have suffixes in Windows, whereas in Linux you can use them as conventions.
  - Unix File System
  - The chunk of the disk is divided into blocks (1024-bytes block, or 4096-bytes block, etc.) in multiple of 512 bytes in size.
  - These blocks are organized into four groupings- boot block, superblock, inode blocks and data blocks.


# File system commands: try them!
- `pwd`          where you are now on the file system?
- `cd`           Return to your home directory
- `df -m`        what disks are on the system and the amount of space available in kilobytes

# Basic commands in UnixTry Them!!
- `who`           The command shows who is logged on
- `finger unid`   Who is unid
- `date`          prints the system date and time
- `man`           formats and displays on-line manual pages
- `history`       List prior commands
- ``!!``          Previous command
- ``! XXX``       Repeat prior command number XXX


# Commands In Unix: Try them!
- `ls`            List contents of directories
    - Option 	Description
  	    -l 	list in long format
  	    -C	multicolumn output
          -F	indicates type of file by /, *
          -R	recursive listing of all subdirectories 			encountered
  	    -a 	list all files including hidden files
  	    -t    sort by time modified

# Commands In Unix

- `cd [directory]`
  change working directory to the directory if specified or to the home directory otherwise
- `cd ..` (go up/back one directory)
- `cd dirname/` Change to dirname directory relative to the location you are currently in

# Making a directory
`cd` (where are you?)
`cd Desktop`
`mkdir temp` (what’s now on your Desktop?)
`cd temp`
`ls`  Are there any files in that directory now?
