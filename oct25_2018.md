# Why Python?
- It is open source
- Syntax relatively intuitive compared to other languages
- Programs can be easier to read due to formatting conventions
    - e.g., indented code blocks
- Interpreted rather than compiled
- Grown into one of the top 5 most popular language for programming
    - Ranking the languages by usage: https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/

# Python 2 vs 3
Differences in coding are relatively minor but can create issues.
- Version 2.7 remains heavily used, but support for it is _rapidly_ being deprecated. [Python 2.7 Retirment Count Down](https://pythonclock.org/).
- __Version 3.6__ is what you should be using.



# Python is:
- Dynamically typed
    - This means the type of variable (integer, float) is determined from the data assigned to that variable.
- Case sensitive
    - temperature, Temperature, and TEMPERATURE are 3 distinct variable names.
- Object oriented
    - Everything is an object, which makes coding very flexible but also can be confusing. 
    - We'll tend to use python in a procedural programming context that should minimize the confusion.

# You can install Python
Python is free software. The easiest way to install Python is to download it from a distribution service, like Anaconda. It takes a lot of space but is worth it.

Make sure you install the 3.6 (or higher) Version.

|Source|URL|Description|
|--|--|--|
|Anaconda|https://www.anaconda.com/download/| Comes with a lot of extra packages for standard data analysis. Some packages you will use and others you probably won't. |
|Miniconda|https://conda.io/miniconda.html| Same as Anaconda but without the fluff that you won't use. Instead, you need to install the packages you will need, but that is easy (e.g. execute `conda install numpy` command to install numpy). If you want to save space on your computer, try this.|
|Python Software Foundation |https://www.python.org/downloads/|The raw source for bare-bones Python. Probably not what you want at this point, unless you are ambitious.|


After installing, make sure the following libraries are installed: `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `Basemap`, `pandas`.

You can install or update packages with the `conda` command:
    
    conda install numpy
    conda install scipy
    conda install matplotlib
    conda install basemap

# Terminology
You need to become familiar with terms used typically for all programming languages

| Term | Description | Example |
|--|--|--|
|Statement| Instruction to a computer| `a = 5`
|Assignment| A statement that binds an expression (object) to a variable (name)| `=`
|Object| Anything that a variable can be referred to |
|Variable| Name of an object |
|Expression| Combo of numbers, text, variables, and operators that result in a new object when evaluated| `y = mx+b`
|Function| A block of statements used to create a new object
|Algorithm| Recipe for how to solve a problem
|Code| Program content
|Executable| File used to run a programs | `filename.py`
|Verification| Providing evidence that the program works correctly
|Debugging| Locating and correcting errors in a programs

# Interactive Python on Macs
In the terminal window, type the following and pay attention to the output:

    which python3

This should tell you the version of python referred to.
    
    python3

You are now in Python's built-in Interactive Development Environment (IDLE). You can use Python much like a calculator. The following commands are Python statements.   
- What does the `/` expression do?  
- What does `//` expression do?  
- What does the `**` expression do?  
- What does the `%` expression do?  

<!---->
    1+2
<!---->
    1/2
<!---->
    1*2
<!---->
    1**2
<!---->  
    1%2

> If you need help with something, type `help()` to view  help documents. You can view help documents for specific functions like this, `help(max)`.
>    
>To exit the `help()`, type `q` or `ctrl-c`. Alternatively, search online for how to do things.

## How to exit the IDLE
Exiting depends on the version installed.

- `quit()`
- `ctrl-d` or `ctrl-z`
- Use `quit` to see which ones apply.

# Code blocks, indentation, and continuation
Type the following. Pay attention to the number of spaces:


    for i in range(0,5):
        x = i*2
        print(x)

Did it work or did you get errors?

What does this code do?

1. This is known as a **for loop**. The following code block executes once for changing values of `i`. Each value of `i` is iterated by the sequence `range(0,3)`. Type `help(range)` to read about what range does. During each loop, the value of `i` is reassigned 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4; the last number, 5, is excluded, as described in the help documents. The colon `:` indicates that a code block follows. Note that each line in the code block is indented exactly 4 spaces. This characteristic of Python make code more readable.

2. For each value of `i`, assign the variable `x` to double the value of `i`.

3. `print()` is a function that takes input (x in this case) and writes to the screen.

> You may use the `\` to extend a statement to the next line (we'll later see that there are exceptions when dealing with lists and arrays)

# Variable names
Variables are names that values are assigned to with the `=` operator. Remember, in programing `=` means _assigned to_ not _equals_.

|Rules for naming variables| Example|
|--|--|
|Names can be a combos of letters and numbers, but can't start with a number.|`alpha3`, `Timer8`
|Names should be descriptive.| `temp` or `temperature` is better than `t`.|
|Names can use underscores for longer names| `potential_temperature`|
|By convention, use all CAPS for constants:| `TEMP_0C_IN_K = 273.15`
|There are 32 keyword names that are reserved becuase they have special meaning in Python.| Cannot use words like `del`, `and`, `if`, `global`, etc. [Reference: Python Keywords](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/keyword-list)

# Data Types
You can find out the type of a variable or expression with the `type()` function. The following are the most necessary types to know.

## Boolean
A boolean is either `True`  or `False`. 
  - `True` equivalent to 1 or 1.0
  - `False` equivalent to 0 or 0.0

Try the following:

    bool(3)
    bool(0)
    bool(1-1)

What was returned in each case?

What does `type(bool(1-1))` do?

## Integer
Integers are numbers with no decimal. They can have a value between `-2**31` and `2**31 - 1`
  - signed integer uses 32 bits (the sign is the 32nd)
  
To convert a value to an integer, try:

    x = 5.333
    y = int(x)
    print(y, type(y))
    print(x, type(x))

## Floating Point
Float use 64 bits (or what is referred to as double precision in many other languages)

To convert a value to a float, try:

    x = 5
    y = float(x)
    print(y, type(y))
    print(x, type(x))


## None
If a variable is created but not assigned a value, then it has the None type

Try:
    
    a = None
    print(a, type(a))

## String
A string is a sequence of characters enclosed by single, double, or tripple quotes.

Try:

    "Hi"
    b = "Hello, I'm John"
    print(b)
  
To format strings use the format function.
    
    x = 9.356
    'The value of x is: {%6.1f}'.format(x)

[Reference: Python String Formatting](https://kapeli.com/cheat_sheets/Python_Format_Strings.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/index)  
[Reference: Python String Syntax](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax)

String interpolation or the string modulor operator is simpler!

    'The value of x is: %s' % x

The first string modulus % indicates the format of the variable after the second %

    x = '%6.1f is less than %3d' % (x,10)

# Lists and Tuples
## Lists
A list is a collection of objects. A list is mutable, meaning that the contents of the list can be changed after it is created.

  - Contents are enclosed by brackets `[]` and separated by commas.
  - Contents do not have to be of the same type.
  
Try:
  
    my_list = [9, -3.5, 'some', 'nothing', True, None, 5]
    my_list

## Tuples
Pronunced _tewple_ and _tupple_. Are similar to lists, but are immutable meaning that the contents can't be changed once it is created. You mihgt use tuples for list of constants that you don't want the program to change.

  - Contents enclosed by parentheses `()` and separated by commas
  - Contents do not have to be of the same type.

Try:

    my_tuple = ('many', 7, False, 'nothing', "hi", None, 10.55)
    my_tuple

## Accessing elements in a list or tuple
In lists, and tuples, the first element is always the 0th item and the last element is -1.

Access a specific item by its location in the list or tuple. Try:

    my_list[0]
    my_list[1]
    my_list[-1]
    my_list[-3]

    my_tuple[0]
    my_tuple[1]
    my_tuple[-1]
    my_tuple[-3]

You can also access consecutive items by a range of indicies.  
Syntax: `my_list[beginning:end:interval]`, where the end index is _one integer greater than the index you want to access_.

  - Think of the beginning and end as boundaries of the elements rather than the index values themselves
  - The interval (or stride) is optional
  - The beginning or end (or both) can be omitted, which will return all of the elements relative to the remining boundary

Try:
    
    my_list[1:3]

Why did only 2 elements of the list show?

    my_tuple[0:2]
    my_list[:]
    my_tuple[:-1]
    my_list[-2:]

By striding through a list you can skip over elements or reverse direction using the striding interval. Try:
    
    my_list[::2]
    my_tuple[::-1]
    my_list[1:4:2]

## Reassigning values in a lists
You can't change the value in a tuple

try:

    a = my_tuple
    a[2] = 'test'

What happened?

try:

    b = my_list
    b[2] = 'test'
    b
